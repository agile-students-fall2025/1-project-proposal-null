**GameShoot — Find the right game in seconds.**

## What and Why?
Choosing what game to play can be overwhelming. Players spend too much time scrolling through stores, wikis, and forums trying to decide. This wastes time and leads to frustration, especially for people with limited budgets, session lengths, or specific hardware.

**GameShoot** solves this by offering a **fast, filter-based web app** where players can search and sort games by:
- Genre and tags (e.g., roguelike, arpg, soulslike)  
- Platform and hardware requirements  
- Price range and discounts  
- Playtime to finish  
- Single-player, local co-op, or online multiplayer  
- Accessibility features  

**Why us?:** Instead of hours of browsing, players can find a fitting game in under a minute. GameShoot reduces decision fatigue, helps people stick to their budget, and makes it easy to discover games they’ll actually enjoy.

## For Whom?
GameShoot is for **real players**, such as:
- Students and hobbyist gamers in campus gaming clubs.  
- Friends and classmates who often ask “what should I play?” in Discord.  

These are our initial end-users, and their feedback will shape the design.
